Widget Search Filter allows you to quickly search & filter your widgets in real time. No more excessive searching, scrolling, and dragging.

== Description ==

Widget Search Filter makes it super easy to find the widget you are looking for by adding a live filter search box to your widgets page. The search box can be used to filter all of your available widgets - simply begin typing the name of the widget youâ€™re looking for, and Widget Search Filter will magically show only matching widgets - all in real time. This can be extremely helpful for sites with lots of widgets, which would normally require excessive scrolling and dragging.
